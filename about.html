                        <p class="text-justify">I am a geographer.  Like most geographers, I have an eclectic collection of interests. The motivation for my research 
                            is the use of remote sensing.  I have leveraged machine learning methods for extracting information from remote 
                            sensing data, studied human factors in remote sensing image use, and have a keen interest in the history of 
                            geospatial technology development. The following is brief narrative about my journey.
                        </p>
                        <h3>early years</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                        I began my journey down the path of Geography in 2004 at Northern Michigan University. My initial academic endeavor 
                        took me to the Hogeschool van Utrecht in the Netherlands in 2000 where I studied Integrated Communications and Marketing. 
                        Neither topic held my interest.  Geography, on the other hand, fully captured my imagination. As an undergraduate student, 
                        I triple majored in Physical Geography, Geology, and Environmental Science (Social Science Option) at the University of 
                        Idaho. I quickly grew fond of geomorphology and remote sensing.  Throughout my time at the University of Idaho, I worked 
                        as an undergraduate research assistant and a geology, geography, and statistics tutor.  
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">   
                            The birth of my son at the end of my Junior year meant stepping back from my geology major, but I remained at the 
                            University of Idaho to obtain my master’s degree in Geography in one year. My topic was discriminant analysis for 
                            tree species classification from moderate-resolution (SPOT-5) imagery in Central Idaho. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            After graduating with my master’s degree, I took up my studies at the Pennsylvania State University, 
                            working with eminent geovisualization scholar Alan MacEachren. While at Penn State, I was fortunate enough 
                            to be introduced to cognitive GIScience. Working with Alan strongly influenced my perspective on remote 
                            sensing imagery interpretation.  My dissertation addressed the role of domain expertise in the decision-making 
                            processes of interpreters during forest disturbance attribution using an interactive image analysis tool.

                        <h3>middle years</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                         Upon conferral my Ph.D. I took a position at Michigan State University in the Geography Department. 
                         There I expanded my remote sensing analytics skillset to object-based image analysis.  I mentored a 
                         number of graduate and undergraduate students in their pursuit of geospatial research. In addition 
                         to publishing a number of peer reviewed journal articles on remote sensing, I also led an international 
                         team in the development of the book Remote Sensing and Cognition: Human Factors in Image. I made the 
                         decision to leave the university in 2021 to pursue a career path with a better work-life balance.
                        </p>
                        <h3>now</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">                     
                            In Summer 2022 I joined the Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science at the University of 
                            Illinois Urbana Champaign. I have begun to pivot my research to Trust and geospatial AI in remote 
                            sensing applications.  In addition to my research, I develop and instruct a variety of Python-driven 
                            geospatial analytics courses to graduate and undergraduate students.
